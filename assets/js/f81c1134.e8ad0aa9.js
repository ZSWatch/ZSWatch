We fund projects that help fix the internet through open hardware, open software, open standards, open science and open data.\\n\\nWhich ZSWatch falls pretty well under.\\n\\nHere we go into more details about what this means.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n### How the funding will be used\\n\\nThe funding will allow [me] to work 50% and [Daniel] to work 20% on ZSWatch. The rest of the money will go to hardware and hardware prototyping costs. The funded project will run for 1 year.\\n\\nThe goal is to both rework and improve ZSWatch. Mainly to make it more accessible to a broader audience and grow the community. This will be done by making it cheaper, easier to assemble and use more accessible parts. Right now getting all parts and assembling a ZSWatch is not super easy, this we aim to change!\\n\\n**Our goal is within one year have a robust watch that is easy to assembly that you can easily get your hands on!**\\n\\n### High level plan\\nThere are so much more details defined, but including that would make this post very long. So here is the high level tasks we aim to finish.\\n:::tip Goals\\n    - New daughter board for health tracking.\\n        - This will be a optional PCB that connects to the main PCB.\\n        - Since HR algorithms are no easy task, we are planning to use [MAX32664(C) Biometric Snesor Hub with embedded algorithms](https://www.analog.com/en/products/max32664.html).\\n    - New main board.\\n        - Cheaper.\\n        - Optimize physical layout for improved mechanical assembly.\\n        - Changes to accomodate the daughter board.\\n    - Change of components on ZSWatch.\\n    - New simpler dock.\\n    - Case redesign.\\n    - Production test software.\\n    - Documentation using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).\\n        - You are reading on it now!\\n        - We will host the blog and all documentation.\\n    - Improve software usability.\\n    - Lightwight app store.\\n        - We want to investigate [Zephyr LLEXT](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/services/llext/index.html) to see if it\'s feasable to dynamically load applications to ZSWatch.\\n    - Testing.\\n        - We need more automated tests to easy catch regressions.\\n    - Phone integration improvements.\\n:::\\n\\nAlso we are looking for feedback, see the [Feedback Blog Post](../2025-03-19-feedback/index.md)\\n\\nWe will post updates of our progress so don\'t forget to sign up for our email list!\\n\\n<SubscriptionForm/>\\n\\n[me]: https://github.com/jakkra\\n[Daniel]: https://github.com/kampi"},{"id":"intro","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/intro","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-13-zswatch-into/index.md","title":"What is ZSWatch","description":"If you have not heard of ZSWatch before, here is a short intro!","date":"2025-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"ZSWatch","permalink":"/blog/tags/zswatch","description":"ZSWatch core"},{"inline":false,"label":"intro","permalink":"/blog/tags/intro","description":"Everything related to intruduction of ZSWatch"}],"readingTime":2.315,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jakob Krantz","title":"Senior Software Engineer and ZSWatch Creator and Maintainer","url":"https://jakobkrantz.se","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/jakkra"},"socials":{"github":"https://github.com/jakkra","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakob-krantz-ba9a97127/"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/jakkra.png","key":"jakkra"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"intro","title":"What is ZSWatch","authors":["jakkra"],"tags":["zswatch","intro"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"We received funding!","permalink":"/blog/funding"}},"content":"If you have not heard of ZSWatch before, here is a short intro!\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\nimport ZSWatchLogo from \'./ZSWatch_logo_with_text.png\';\\nimport SubscriptionForm from \'@site/src/components/SubscriptionForm\';\\nimport ReactPlayer from \'react-player\'\\nimport HardwareOverview from \'@site/static/img/Hardware_Overview_transparent.png\'\\n\\nBuilt on the [Zephyr\u2122 Project](https://www.zephyrproject.org/) RTOS, hence the name **ZSWatch** - *Zephyr Smartwatch*.\\n\\nZSWatch is a free and open source smartwatch you can build almost from scratch - including software, hardware, and mechanics.

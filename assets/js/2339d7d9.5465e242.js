We fund projects that help fix the internet through open hardware, open software, open standards, open science and open data.\\n\\nWhich ZSWatch falls pretty well under.\\n\\n### How the funding will be used\\n\\nThe funding will allow [me] to work 50% and [Daniel] to work 20% on ZSWatch. The rest of the money will go to hardware and hardware prototyping costs. The funded project will run for 1 year.\\n\\nThe goal is to both rework and improve ZSWatch. Mainly to make it more accessible to a broader audience and grow the community. This will be done by making it cheaper, easier to assemble and use more accessible parts.\\n\\n**Our goal is within one year have a robust watch that is easy to assembly that you can easily get your hands on!**\\n\\n### High level plan\\nThere are so much more details defined, but including that would make this post very long. So here is the high level tasks we aim to finish.\\n:::tip Goals\\n    - New daughter board for health tracking.\\n        - This will be a optional PCB that connects to the main PCB.\\n        - Since HR algorithms are no easy task, we are planning to use [MAX32664(C) Biometric Snesor Hub with embedded algorithms](https://www.analog.com/en/products/max32664.html).\\n    - New main board.\\n        - Cheaper.\\n        - Optimize physical layout for improved mechanical assembly.\\n        - Changes to accomodate the daughter board.\\n    - Change of components on ZSWatch.\\n    - New simpler dock.\\n    - Case redesign.\\n    - Production test software.\\n    - Documentation using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).\\n        - You are reading on it now!\\n        - We will host the blog and all documentation.\\n    - Improve software usability.\\n    - Lightwight app store.\\n        - We want to investigate [Zephyr LLEXT](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/services/llext/index.html) to see if it\'s feasable to dynamically load applications to ZSWatch.\\n    - Testing.\\n        - We need more automated tests to easy catch regressions.\\n    - Phone integration improvements.\\n:::\\n\\nWe will post updates of our progress so don\'t forget to sign up for our email list!\\n\\nimport SubscriptionForm from \'@site/src/components/SubscriptionForm\';\\n\\n<SubscriptionForm/>\\n\\n[me]: https://github.com/jakkra\\n[Daniel]: https://github.com/kampi"},{"id":"intro","metadata":{"permalink":"/ZSWatch/blog/intro","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-13-zswatch-into/index.md","title":"ZSWatch Intro","description":"If you have not heard of ZSWatch before, here is a short intro!","date":"2025-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"ZSWatch","permalink":"/ZSWatch/blog/tags/zswatch","description":"ZSWatch core"}],"readingTime":0.375,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jakob Krantz","title":"Senior Software Engineer and ZSWatch Creator and Maintainer","url":"https://jakobkrantz.se","page":{"permalink":"/ZSWatch/blog/authors/jakkra"},"socials":{"github":"https://github.com/jakkra","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakob-krantz-ba9a97127/"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/jakkra.png","key":"jakkra"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"intro","title":"ZSWatch Intro","authors":["jakkra"],"tags":["zswatch"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Funding","permalink":"/ZSWatch/blog/funding"}},"content":"If you have not heard of ZSWatch before, here is a short intro!\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\nimport ZSWatchLogo from \'./ZSWatch_logo_with_text.png\';\\n\\n<img src={ZSWatchLogo} />\\n\\nZSWatch is a free and open source smartwatch you can build almost from scratch - including software, hardware, and mechanics.

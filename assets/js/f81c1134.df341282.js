This board helps us test components, write drivers, and troubleshoot more easily before moving to a final compact version.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo simplify testing, we integrated an **nRF54L15 BLE MCU**, allowing the board to operate as a standalone unit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cool part? It can stream heart rate data live to the ZSWatch over Bluetooth! Below is a quick demo of heart rate data being plotted in real time. It\'s still very much a hacky prototype\u2014but it works.\\r\\n\\r\\n<img src={HrBLE} />\\r\\n\\r\\nCheck out the in-progress driver and app here:  \\r\\n[https://github.com/ZSWatch/Zephyr-MAX32664C](https://github.com/ZSWatch/Zephyr-MAX32664C)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Firmware Updates via BLE and USB\\r\\nWe\u2019ve added a bootloader, which means you can now update the ZSWatch firmware wirelessly via BLE\u2014or through USB (in case ZSWatch firmware breaks and Bluetooth isn\u2019t available.).\\r\\n\\r\\nEven better: you can update directly from the [Firmware Update page on zswatch.dev](https://zswatch.dev/update).  \\r\\nFirmware artifacts are pulled from GitHub Actions automatically, making updates simple.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also added support for uploading the full **filesystem image**, which contains most UI assets.\\r\\n\\r\\n<img src={FotaScreenshot} />\\r\\n\\r\\nImprovements for later:\\r\\n- Ideally, only real known working releases should show\\r\\n- Bundle firmware and filesystem into a single update process\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can also update the firmware using [nRF Connect Device Manager](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Connect-Device-Manager) or other tools listed in the [Zephyr documentation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/services/device_mgmt/mcumgr.html#tools-libraries).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Bonus (XIP)\\r\\nAnother smaller, but very important update is that we after some fiddling around got **XIP (Execute-in-Place)** working on ZSWatch, allowing code to be run directly from the external flash. It was essential to fit the bootloader and USB support, and it opens up a lot more headroom for the firmware going forward.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Next up\\r\\n- Evaluate the health tracking PCB\u2019s performance\\r\\n- Design a casing for wearing the health tracking PCB in order \\r\\n\\r\\n<br></br>\\r\\n\\r\\n*Want to stay in the loop?

We fund projects that help fix the internet through open hardware, open software, open standards, open science and open data.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhich ZSWatch falls pretty well under.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere we go into more details about what this means.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n### How the funding will be used\\r\\n\\r\\nThe funding will allow [me] to work 50% and [Daniel] to work 20% on ZSWatch. The rest of the money will go to hardware and hardware prototyping costs. The funded project will run for 1 year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goal is to both rework and improve ZSWatch. Mainly to make it more accessible to a broader audience and grow the community. This will be done by making it cheaper, easier to assemble and use more accessible parts. Right now getting all parts and assembling a ZSWatch is not super easy, this we aim to change!\\r\\n\\r\\n**Our goal is within one year have a robust watch that is easy to assembly that you can easily get your hands on!**\\r\\n\\r\\n### High level plan\\r\\nThere are so much more details defined, but including that would make this post very long. So here is the high level tasks we aim to finish.\\r\\n:::tip Goals\\r\\n    - Support daughter board interface attached to the main PCB.\\r\\n        - This allows to keep core ZSWatch chaper.\\r\\n        - Allows expandability.\\r\\n        - Expand with any feature you need.\\r\\n            - Health tracking (this we will do).\\r\\n            - Additional sensors.\\r\\n            - A GPS maybe?\\r\\n            - Go crazy and add cellular maybe?\\r\\n            - Unlimited possibilities.\\r\\n    - New daughter board for health tracking.\\r\\n        - This will be a optional PCB that connects to the main PCB.\\r\\n        - Since HR algorithms are no easy task, we are planning to use [MAX32664(C) Biometric Snesor Hub with embedded algorithms](https://www.analog.com/en/products/max32664.html).\\r\\n    - New main board.\\r\\n        - Cheaper.\\r\\n        - Optimize physical layout for improved mechanical assembly.\\r\\n        - Changes to accomodate daughter boards.\\r\\n    - Change of components on ZSWatch.\\r\\n    - New simpler dock.\\r\\n    - Case redesign.\\r\\n    - Production test software.\\r\\n    - Documentation using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).\\r\\n        - You are reading on it now!\\r\\n        - We will host the blog and all documentation.\\r\\n    - Improve software usability.\\r\\n    - Lightwight app store.\\r\\n        - We want to investigate [Zephyr LLEXT](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/services/llext/index.html) to see if it\'s feasable to dynamically load applications to ZSWatch.\\r\\n    - Testing.\\r\\n        - We need more automated tests to easy catch regressions.\\r\\n    - Phone integration improvements.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso we are looking for feedback, see the [Feedback Blog Post](../2025-03-19-feedback/index.md)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will post updates of our progress so don\'t forget to sign up for our email list!\\r\\n\\r\\n<SubscriptionForm/>\\r\\n\\r\\n[me]: https://github.com/jakkra\\r\\n[Daniel]: https://github.com/kampi"},{"id":"intro","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/intro","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-13-zswatch-into/index.md","title":"What is ZSWatch","description":"If you have not heard of ZSWatch before, here is an intro!","date":"2025-03-13T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"ZSWatch","permalink":"/blog/tags/zswatch","description":"ZSWatch core"},{"inline":false,"label":"intro","permalink":"/blog/tags/intro","description":"Everything related to intruduction of ZSWatch"}],"readingTime":2.425,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jakob Krantz","title":"Senior Software Engineer and ZSWatch Creator and Maintainer","url":"https://jakobkrantz.se","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/jakkra"},"socials":{"github":"https://github.com/jakkra","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakob-krantz-ba9a97127/"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/jakkra.png","key":"jakkra"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"intro","title":"What is ZSWatch","authors":["jakkra"],"tags":["zswatch","intro"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"We received funding!","permalink":"/blog/funding"}},"content":"If you have not heard of ZSWatch before, here is an intro!\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\nimport SubscriptionForm from \'@site/src/components/SubscriptionForm\';\\r\\nimport ReactPlayer from \'react-player\'\\r\\nimport HardwareOverview from \'@site/static/img/Hardware_Overview_transparent.png\'\\r\\n\\r\\nimport StainlessWatchStand from \'@site/static/img/real_photos/stainless_stand.JPG\'\\r\\nimport StainlessWatchFrontWide from \'@site/static/img/real_photos/stainless_front_wide.JPG\'\\r\\nimport ClearWatchFrontWide from \'@site/static/img/real_photos/clear_front_wide.JPG\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBuilt on the [Zephyr\u2122 Project](https://www.zephyrproject.org/) RTOS, hence the name **ZSWatch** - *Zephyr Smartwatch*.\\r\\n\\r\\nZSWatch is a free and open source smartwatch you can build almost from scratch - including software, hardware, and mechanics.
